        <p>
          This project uses automation tools, AI assistance, and public APIs (e.g., GitHub, Safe{Wallet}, and Discord).
        </p>

        <h2>Automated Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub Actions and Discord bots may propose or relay transactions on your behalf, but they never sign or execute them without explicit approval by wallet owners.
        </p>

        <h2>AI Tools</h2>
        <p>
          This project occasionally uses AI to format proposals and documentation. No decisions about finances or governance are made by AI.
